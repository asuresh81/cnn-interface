## CNN-Interface - A COMP 523 Project

### Project Summary
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to analyze images of cells and annotate boundaries, instead of performing this tedious process by hand. Weâ€™re developing a UI for microscopists to quickly, efficiently annotate cell boundaries and make measurements using a CNN.
